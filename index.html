    Main Information
    <br>
    <br>
    To spawn an object, click on your desired object. Then simply click anywhere on the screen to spawn it in.
    <br>
    <br>
    When a collision occurs; one planet will be destroyed losing everything.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can change many values of the different bodies, even the most fundamental ones such as the mass or volume. Experiment with see and see what chaos you can cause.
    <br>
    <br>
    I would suggest starting with trying to make your own mini solar system with just one sun and one planet. Then see if you can add a moon without throwing the planet into the sun. 
    <br>
    Good Luck  :)

    Fun Information
    <br>
    <br>
    You can change the formulas used to calculate gravity in a drop down menu. This will allow you to see how doubling gravity or halving it would affect not only our solar system but one which you have made.
    <br>
    <br>
    You will have a very basic solar sytem to start with just to demonstrate how the different objects will interact with eachother.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hope you have fun :)
