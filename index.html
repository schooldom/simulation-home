    To spawn an object you click on the picture showing your desired astronomical object. This will change the outline to white to show you which object you have chosen. Then simply click anywhere on the screen to spawn it in it.

    When a collsion occurs; one planet will be destoryed losing all mass and the other will lose mass then slowly gain some mass back over time. You can guess which one will be which, but watch out. One might have more mass but it might be less dense.

    You can change many values of the different bodies, even the most fundamental ones such as the mass or volume a planet takes up. Experiment with see and see what chaos you can cause.
    <br>
    <br>
    I would suggest starting with trying to make your own mini solar system with just one sun and one planet. Then see if you can add a moon without throwing the planet into the sun.

    Good Luck  :)
